# Kbeznak Parmatonic
### One stop shop for all you kbeznak parmatonic needs

This will be a unique and kind of weird blog where I will ramble on about two words (kbeznak parmatonic) which do not have any meaning (at this point of time). But hey, if there can be a bunch of people who can consider the spaghetti monster as a god and name a religion called Pastafarianism after it, then who knows... these two words could go on to define an entire new culture in the next century.

Regardless, this will be the one stop shop for all your _**Kbeznak Parmatonic**_ needs. Which should be pretty obvious since there is hardly anything to know about it. Those words are in bold and italics for obvious reasons!

Keep watching this space for more information. **Kbeznak Parmatonic!!!**
